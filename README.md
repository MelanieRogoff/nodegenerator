# nodegenerator

This project is a GitHub Profile Generator, coded primarily in Node.JS. The goal of this project is to generate PDF files displaying a GitHub user's profile image, user name, location link via Google Maps (will display upon clicking the location icon), the user's GitHub profile (displayed upon clicking on the GitHub icon), the user blog (displayed upon clicking on the icon with three lines, which denotes a blog), the user's bio, number of public repositories, followers, GitHub stars, and the number of users that the selected user is following. 

The app works by doing the following:

1) Cloning the nodegenerator and opening it in Terminal/Bash
2) Going to the specific filepath of the nodegenerator and typing in 'node index.js'

Steps are outlined in the following GIF as well, which demonstrates full functionality of the app:
